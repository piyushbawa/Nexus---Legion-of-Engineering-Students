# Nexus---Legion-of-Engineering-Students
This website aims to eradicate the hassle of unilateral websites by allowing students to select and
study various domains of their choice on a single platform. Consequently, it should redirect the
user to the appropriate dashboard page after a successful login or signup. The model should enable
personalization via suggestions for the user interest space. Apart from that, the user should be able
to do searches in the following domains:
A roadmap for preparation, course sites, YouTube channels for relevant skills, societies on campus
and their culture, workspace and opportunities inside the campus, books, research, movies and
music, gaming and podcasts, trips, and clubs. Recommendations made by content-based filtering
are determined by the user's choices for product features. Using collaborative filtering,
user-to-user recommendations are mimicked. It makes predictions about users' preferences as a
weighted, linear combination of those of other users.
